# Exercise 1:
# Write a shell script that consists of a function that display the number of files in the present
# working directory. Name this function "file_count" and call it in your script. If you use a variable
# in your function, remember to make it a local variable.
# Hint: The wcâ€‹utility is used to count the number of lines, words, and bytes.
function e1() {
	local count=$(ls | wc -l)
	echo "Total file count under current directory is: ${count}" 
}

# Exercise 2:
# Modify the script from the previous exercise. Make the "file_count" function accept a directory
# as an argument. Next have the function display the name of the directory followed by a colon.
# Finally, display the number of files to the screen on the next line. Call the function three times.
# First, on the "/etc" directory, next on the "/var" directory and finally on the "/usr/bin" directory.
# Example output:
# /etc:
# 85
